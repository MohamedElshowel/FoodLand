# FoodLand

## Overview

### The challenge

In Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt, regular food outlets and restaurants do not provide dieticiansâ€™ recommended meals to people with certain health conditions or special dietary requirements.

### Propsed Solution

Foodland is a blockchain-based webapp enabling value-creating interactions between dieticians, food sellers, and food consumers. The platform aims to consummate matches among users and facilitate the exchange of tokenized healthy meal recipes and delivery on Velas ecosystem.
